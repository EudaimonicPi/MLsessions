# Week 5 & 6 Machine Learning Session Materials

This repo contains colab notebooks to support learning of machine learning fundamentals. The notebooks were created directly from Google Colab, and should all include 'open with colab' buttons at the top. Colab is "a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free of charge access to computing resources" [source](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) 

If you are a student, please do not view `_instructor` files before the class session. These files contain solutions to problem sets you will work on.
